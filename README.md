To investigate the theory of hypofunction of Î±7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors in the pathoetiology of Schizophrenia, I modeled the realistic biophysics of the 
aberrant neuronal circuitry implicated in neuroimaging studies in the NEURON Simulation Environment using the hoc and Python programming languages. The model comprises 
Pyramidal cells and GABA interneurons in the PFC, expressing 19 ion channels, 5 receptors, buffering mechanism, leak currents, and Sodium, Potassium and Calcium pumps.
