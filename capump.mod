:
: Internal calcium concentration due to calcium currents and pump.
: Differential equations.
:
: Simple model of ATPase pump with 3 kinetic constants (Destexhe 92)
:     Cai + P <-> CaP -> Cao + P  (k1,k2,k3)
: A Michaelis-Menten approximation is assumed, which reduces the complexity
: of the system to 2 parameters: 
:       kt = <tot enzyme concentration> * k3  -> TIME CONSTANT OF THE PUMP
:	kd = k2/k1 (dissociation constant)    -> EQUILIBRIUM CALCIUM VALUE
: The values of these parameters are chosen assuming a high affinity of 
: the pump to calcium and a low transport capacity (cfr. Blaustein, 
: TINS, 11: 438, 1988, and references therein).  
:
: Units checked using "modlunit" -> factor 10000 needed in ca entry
:
: VERSION OF PUMP + DECAY (decay can be viewed as simplified buffering)
:
: All variables are range variables
:
:
: This mechanism was published in:  Destexhe, A. Babloyantz, A. and 
: Sejnowski, TJ.  Ionic mechanisms for intrinsic slow oscillations in
: thalamic relay neurons. Biophys. J. 65: 1538-1552, 1993)
